TODO

* Pretend the `home` app signs in and generates a token (JWT?). This should
  be passed into every sub-app.

* CircleCI example.

* Why did I not have to do these `.babelrc` tricks?
  https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/blob/master/packages/react-router-dom/docs/guides/code-splitting.md

* having to mess with prefixes inside routes for Normandy app is sucky.

* Normandy-only tests, for example.

* Unit testing to run `/normandy` in the home App fails hard.

DONE

* Running tests.

* Use source-map-explorer to inspect build chunks and where heavy things
  like redux ends up.

* Mix things like Redux in different apps.
